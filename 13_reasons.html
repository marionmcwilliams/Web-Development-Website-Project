		<h2>About the Book</h2>
		<p>
			13 Reason Why is a book written by Jay Asher. The story follows various high school
			students. Among them is Clay Jensen who, upon returning home from school, finds a 
			package with his name on it at his doorstep. Inside the package lies several cassette tapes 
			belonging to his former classmate and crush, Hannah Baker, who had recently committed suicide. 
			While listening to the tapes, Clay hears Hannah say that there are thirteen reasons as to
			why she committed suicide and Clay was one of them. By listening further, Clay will soon
			discover why.

		<h2>Reason for Banning</h2>
		<p>
			13 Reasons Why was the most challenged book of 2017 due to its heavy use of suicide, bullying, 
			consensual sex, and related themes. The book was also on the 2012 top ten list due to the book
			 covering drug use, alcohol use, suggestive themes, and suicide. It seems that the book was 
			 challenged so heavily in 2017 given the fact that the Netflix series of the same name was released.
			  It managed to be even more graphic than the novel itself.
