		<h2>Reason for Banning</h2>
		<p>
			In 1999, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was listed as one of the top 100 most challenged books 
			of the decade despite it only being out for two years at that point. Between 2000 and 2009, it made its 
			way to the top of that list. Most of the challenges had to do with sex, the human body or inappropriate language. 
			Some have even said that Harry Potter glorified magic and the occult, confusing children and leading them 
			to trying to replicate spells and curses.
