		<h2>About the Book</h2>
		<p>
			Of Mice and Men is a 1937 novel written by John Steinbeck. Two drifters are in search of work. 
			George and his simple-minded friend Lennie constantly dream that one day they will have some land 
			to call their own. Eventually, they find work on a ranch in California’s Salinas Valley. Quickly, 
			their hopes are doomed. This is because Lennie, struggling against extreme cruelty, misunderstanding 
			and feelings of jealousy, becomes a victim of his own strength.

		<h2>Reason for Banning</h2>
		<p>
			Despite experiencing immediate success and even movie adaptation, Of Mice and Men as been challenged 
			constantly over the decades. Some people have made complaints about the use of profanity, morbid and 
			depressing themes, and the author’s alleged supposed anti-business attitude. Others have called it 
			&ldquo;derogatory towards African Americans, women, and the developmentally disabled.&rdquo;
