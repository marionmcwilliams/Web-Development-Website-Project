			<h2>What even is a Banned Book?</h2>	
			<p>
				A banned book can be defined as any book that has been challenged or outright removed.
				According to the American Library Association, a challenge is when there is an attempt
				to remove restricted materials. A challenge does not simply involve a person expressing
				their negative feelings toward the book; it involves attempts to remove the book from
				school courses and libraries.

			<h2>Why are some Books Banned?</h2>	
			<p>
				More often than not, books are challenged or banned in an attempt to protect
				children from sensitve issues or difficult ideas. as reported by the  Office of 
				Intellectual Freedom, the main three reasons for books being challenged or banned
				were:<br><br>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The books contained offensive language</li>
				<li>The books were of a sexually explicit nature</li>
				<li>The books were seen as unsuitable for any age group</li>
			</ul><br><br>
			<p>
				There is an ongoing discussion in terms of the legallity of banning books. Many people have
				argued that it is unconstitutional to have the government prohibit the expression of an idea
				on the grounds that people deem that idea as offensive.

			<h2>Should you read Banned Books?</h2>	
			<p>
				I would definitely recommend read some challenged or banned books. Many of the books
				covered on the website are books I've read in my spare time or for school assignments.
				Naturally, some material in certain bannded books may rub people the wrong way so I would
				say do research on a book before you consider buying or renting it. Banned books are similar
				to violent video games. For some people, they are seen as harmless fun, but to others,
				they should be avoided and removed at all costs.
