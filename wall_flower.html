		<h2>About the Book</h2>
		<p>
			The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a 1999 novel written by Stephen Chbosky. The story follows Charlie, a tremendously 
			introverted kid, through his high school coming-of-age moment. Charlie links to write letters for the sake of writing them. 
			They come off as unique, hilarious, and devastating. Though his location is never mentioned, nor the intended recipient of his letters, 
			We do know is the world he lives in. He seems caught between trying to live and run away from his life at the same time. He attempts to 
			Traverse a world full of first dates,family dramas, new friends, and drugs but all he requires is that the perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite.

		<h2>Reason for Banning</h2>
		<p>
			Like every other book on this site, The Perks of being a Wallflower has been challenged and banned many times. As early as 2003, 
			school libraries in Fairfax, VA challenged the book for it having profanity and descriptions of drug abuse. Even as recently as 
			2019 the book was challenged in the Beaverton School District in Oregon. People claimed that the characters of the book were 
			bad role models that abused drugs and had underage sex.
