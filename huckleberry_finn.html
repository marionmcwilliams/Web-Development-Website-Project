		<h2>Reason for Banning</h2>
		<p>
			The book was banned as early as 1885. Almost all of the challenges to the book were a result of it being
			 deemed racist for the repeated use of the n word. Others would often make the completely ambiguous statement 
			 that the book &ldquo;conflicted with the values of the community.&rdquo; Around the time of its publishing, some 
			 librarians were unhappy with the book, claiming that the language was too rough.
